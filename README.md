# 🧩 CryptoThreads-CSharp

A testing platform developed in **C# (.NET)** language to test the performance of cryptographic algorithms (AES, RSA) and multithreaded text processing. The project allows to evaluate the capabilities of .NET in terms of speed, resource management and simplicity of implementation of security and concurrency functions.

## 📘 Project description

The aim of the project is:

- Implementation of encryption and decryption (AES, RSA) using .NET libraries,
- Use of multithreading to process large text collections,
- Measuring execution time, CPU and RAM usage,
- Evaluation of the effectiveness and suitability of the C# language in the context of cryptographic and concurrent operations.

## 🔍 Functionalities

## 🛡 Cryptographic mode:
- AES and RSA support using built-in .NET classes,
- Custom text selection or random data generation,
- Configurable: text length, key length, number of passwords.

### 🔄 Text processing mode:
- Search for keywords in text files using multiple threads,
- Configurable parameters: number of threads, keywords, source file.

### 📊 Performance measurement:
- Running time,
- CPU and RAM measurement.
